BootstrapAppBase
=======
Bootstrap responsive web app basetemplate.

[Demo](http://diamonddev.com/demo/BootstrapAppBase/)


###What is this?
This template is a starter help for responsive web apps, with a few basic components:

* A Sidebar, that collapses on mobile
* A Body that always fills the rest of the available space
* A Navbar with burger button to toggle the mobile

It should serve as a base for easy responsive Web Apps

###What should become out of it
The goal of it is to create a collection of basic elements and behaviours for responsive web apps with a focus on mobile.

###Install
 Since all Vendors (jQuery, Bootstrap) are linked via bower (http://bower.io/), you need to install bower and install all vendors with it:

 	$ bower install
